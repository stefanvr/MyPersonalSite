##Power on
While diving into a new technology stack and getting inspired by colleagues and experts in the field, I finally got sparked to start writing my own blog.

##Loading...
There are multiple angles to this blog, to mention a few: 

###Software craftsmanship
At companies like [8thlight][], with craftsman like [Uncle Bob] and where [clean code] is promoted: apprentices are expected to blog as part of their learning and growing. [Chad Fowler][] wrote the book "[The passionate programmer][]". This book has a topic of "Investing in Your Product", where the product is yourself. Throughout the book the topic of "starting" to do things and even the sentence "Now open your own weblog" emphasis the need to take action.

Truth said: blogging has been at the back of my mind, but I always blocked myself. Now I finally kicked myself in the butt.

###Tips and tricks for getting things done
I half started more then once. My main idea was a crossing between [LifeHacker] on "Tips, tricks, and downloads for getting things done" and [Scott Hanselman] with his "ultimate tools list". An article like the one from [Arjan van der Gaag] explaining his workflow on an Mac is in line with my thoughts. In the past I considerd that such articles would likely become one off's topic in my head, no structure and bound to fail for me after a few articles.

Moving to a new technology stack, trying to find my way and getting effective again, fuels me to start this journal. Just letting go of the "what if's", forming a vision and trusting in the outcome.

### Knowledge base for myself
With the power of search engines, keeping a personal knowledge base seems useless. Yet the following is not uncommon among the bloggers of the world:

![Tweet from Ariejan: He googled and ended up on his own site](/images/searchandfind.PNG).

Re-finding good information sometimes seems harder than finding information. So as and alternative of keeping bookmarks and text files[^1] with notes on my hard drive to search through, why not put it on my blog.

There are enough things I dive into, so no excuses left not to blog. 

###Learning
Like with kata's, as for example done during the [coderetreat's] started by [Corey Haines], this is for me an exercise in getting better in expressing myself. I can be quite verbose. On this blog I will keep the famous quote from Mark twain to mind "Sorry I didn't have time to write a shorter letter". 

So I will practise to capture essence, in my own style. 

##Ready.
So while I'm regaining [The joy of coding], joined a new [Guild] and continue to uphold the [Clean coder] principles: I start this new endeavor...

[^1]: Text files seem hardware, OS and hype resistant and there is always a tool available to search through the bunch.
